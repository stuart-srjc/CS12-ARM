// perform the following work as outlined in the comments below, you will turn in a screenshot of the run of this program, along with your source code, when your done
// Using MOV/MOVK set the value of X2 to 0xFACED000000DECAF
// Then using the library call printX2 print the value to the screen

// your code goes here

// MOVK
// We want to put the value 0x123456789ABCDEF0 in register 1
// With ARM we cannot do this in one instruction sow we need to fill it 16 bytes at a time with MOVK
// First we move the least significant portion into the register
// using a MOVK we will move in the next 16 bits

// your code goes here




// I have linked a library cs12Lib to this file via the Makefile
// you are not responsible to know how the file works, but I have left the source code (not well documented at the moment) if you wish to read it
// one of the functions of this library is to allow you to print out the value of registers 1-30
// you call this in the manner seen below
BL printX1


// MOVN
// move the 1Ê»s complement of the value 0x0531 into X2
// then print the value to the screen

// your code goes here




// ADD
// add register X1 and X2 together into X3 and print the value to the screen
 
// your code goes here




// SUB
// subtract register X2 from X1 into X4 and print the value to the screen

// your code goes here




// ADC
// lets look at carry operations
// fill register X5 with the value 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF and print the value to the screen
// note there are several ways to set the register to this value, some in a single operation

// your code goes here




// now lets add 1 to register X5, but use the ADDS (Status bit flag on)
// be careful not to add any instructions after the ADDS or the carry flag may change 

// your code goes here




// at this point X5 should be 0, and the carry flag should be set
// using ADC lets see if the carry bit was set 
// ADC into X6 the value in X6 (0) plus the carry flag 
// X6 = X6 + X7 + CarryFlag
// Use register X7 as a temporary register for this call and store 0 in it, it will be the final parameter to ADC
// then print out X5 and X6

// your code goes here





// SBC
// Fill register 7 with the value 1
// then subtract 1, but use the SUBS instruction so the carry flag can clear
// do not print the vaule out yet

// your code goes here




// set R8 to 5
// Now run SBC into X8 subtracting X9 from X8
// X8 = X8 - X9 - CarryFlag
// Use register X9 as a temporary register for this call and store 0 in it, it will be the final parameter to SBC
// print out the values for X7 and X8

// your code goes here




// The value above should have X8 still holding the value 5
// Run all the commands (in the SBC Section) again (but leave X7 with its existing value) 
// This will  SBC section to see the carry flag drop the value to 4
// print out the values for X7 and X8

// your code goes here




// you will now do a printshot of your programs output and post, along with your source code to canvas
// Note that the correct ouput is here, I will run your application, your screen shot is subplimental your grade will come from your code.
